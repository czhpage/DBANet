# **DBANet: Dual Boundary Awareness With Confidence-Guided Pseudo Labeling for Medical Image Segmentation (IEEE JBHI, 2025)** 
This is the official PyTorch implementation of our paper. DBANet is designed to mitigate class imbalance and boundary vagueness under limited annotated settings. It consists of a dual-branch network with a novel **dynamic boundary awareness** modules and a **confidence-guided pseudo-label** module, effectively learning from both labeled and unlabeled data under limited annotated settings.

Highlights: 
- 🏆 State-of-the-art performance on the Synapse and WORD datasets.
- ⚡ Efficient training and inference.
- 🔧 Easy to train and test on your own data.
